# Artificial_neural_network
Solving a business problem to help banks analyse the reason behind customers closing their accounts.
ANN Model - using keras (tensorflow 1.44)
* using sequential method of intialising the Neural network
* input layer : with 11 input nodes(independent variables)
* hidden layers : 2 hidden layers with 6 nodes each using Rectifier activation function
* output layer : single node using Sigmoid activation function

->Stochastic Gradient Descent('adam algorithm) with 'Binary_crossentropy' loss function
-> training using 100 epochs
-> ideal for processing over CPU
-> max_accuracy achieved = 85%
